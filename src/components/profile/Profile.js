      > I am a recent graduate in BSc Computing (First Class degree) with three monthsâ€™ relevant experience as a front-end developer (React). 
      Through this experience, I learnt how to work independently and be a team player. 
      During my time at university, I gained time management, problem-solving, multitasking and planning skills 
      as sometimes courseworks were due at the same time with their exam I learnt how to stay motivated when I face challenges. 
      I am seeking a graduate backend role using Java/C# but also willing to learn new languages, frameworks and technologies required for the role.
